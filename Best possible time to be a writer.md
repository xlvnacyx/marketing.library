# writing vs content

> [!info]
> **Content is fluid and malleable; art is something you finish and can no longer edit.**

> One distinction Leigh draws between her writing and her content is effort; her writing is “always professionally edited,” whereas her newsletter has no editor and is written quickly in 1–2 hours … Leigh’s distinctions are useful and should be used as a model for any writer or creator, but depending on your preferred creative media, you may need to tweak the distinction.

“**should** be used as a model for any writer or creative”? Perhaps. Seems silly to insist on it, but it isn’t a bad consideration.

> [!quote]
> A writer's task in the creator economy is to grow their audience by producing content that their readers want to see and hear so that those readers will find their art, their books.

# attention is earned
Attention is a limited resource. It has to be worth it to the consumer to spend their attention on your bullshit.

> For a brief window, when fewer people were publishing on the internet, it was extremely easy to get your content in front of others. It’s harder now than it used to be, but still true in the infancy of any platform with built-in discoverability; many of the most successful writers on Substack were early adopters, and now it’s harder to build an audience there; the same is already true of Bluesky.

> It’s still easy to get your work in front of other people, even at scale, but doing so requires more specialist knowledge than it used to; posting blindly into the ether used to be more effective than it is now.

# content as joy, not chore
Ugh … this is what I struggle with.

Content is a dialogue, an opportunity for participation. This serves as a point of differentiation from writing: once a story or tale is done, it’s done, whereas as commentary and conversation can be attached to content.

> Making content is a chore if all you want to do is write — in the sense that Leigh speaks about writing. The trick, I find, is in reframing those two things. The internet requires us to be full-spectrum communicators, not just to be good at writing, but to be good at crystallizing _ideas_, at understanding (by actively discovering) what audiences respond to …

# steal this tactic

> Come up with a side project.
> 
> Think about what would be a fun side project and say, what if, instead of _thinking_ _of starting_ a newsletter, what if I started a project where I invited other people to do this thing with me? What if we did it for 30 days? What if we did it for three months?
> 
> Give it a limited time window.
> 
> Or say, I'm going to post on _Y_ platform once a day for _X_ number of days. Let people in on the project. Tell people. It doesn't have to be a secret.
> 
> You can announce it and say, you know, ‘I'm going to try to do this. I'm a little nervous. And I'm worried I'm going to look stupid.’ Invite people along.
> 
> Even if that side project doesn't get you 10,000 followers, you'll learn by doing it. You'll learn the platform. Or you'll learn, wow, those nine things didn't work. But the thing I did on day 10 totally worked!
> 
> It's just about trying something and having a mindset of playing on the playground.

Some guidelines to this approach:
## pick a length of time
One month should be the minimum for most projects.
## pick a collaborator
If you can do you, you do you. But if you need a second party to keep you accountable, it’s easier to get someone involved for a temporary project than an endless project.
## actually follow through.
Like, do the damn thing.

> The lesson here is to run side projects either separately or within your main projects and treat them like a limited series. **Set rules. It’s easier to complete a challenge when you know where it ends.**
