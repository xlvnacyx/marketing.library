The meat of the newsletter is almost all the way at the bottom:

# why your total subscriber number *doesn't* matter

What matters most:
1. Revenue and profit
2. Customer/Client success and retention

# what you can learn from my experience

## 1 email is the best way to sell things. Newsletters are the best way to build engagement and trust in the inbox.

### build trust

1. Send a high quality newsletter once a week
2. Create an automated welcome sequence that nurtures new subscribers

### sell

Send dedicated marketing emails to segments of your list.

### review

The newsletter develops trust and engagement. The marketing emails generate sales. You need both to win.

## 2 collect data about your subscribers (and phone numbers)

You need more than email. You can use a survey to collect data with which to attract sponsors, and collecting phone numbers will help with SMS marketing.

## 3 learn how to turn advertising into profit

Big tech is incentivized to make advertisers successful. If you can convert ad traffic from Meta, Google, and other channels into customers and sponsorship revenue profitably — you’re in a better position than 99% of businesses.

## 4 master 1 paid growth channel and 1 organic growth channel

Find one paid channel, one organic channel, and focus. It takes two to tango.

## 5 get good at selling things

There's only one way to make money from your audience: Sell products/services. You can sell in-house products or services, or indirectly via sponsorships. A media business in 2025 should be able to do **both** successfully.

Newsletter sponsorships/ads are one of *worst* ways to sell. Businesses that drive most of their revenue from newsletter ads are hurting. They _can_ sell. But not as well as dedicated emails, custom content, webinars, lead gen, and other marketing methods.
