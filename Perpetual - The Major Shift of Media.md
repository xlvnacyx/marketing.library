A few points to consider here:

## media paradigm shifts about every 10 years

Big shifts in media production and consumption occur around every decade.

## the golden age of newsletters

Newsletters have become the new journalism, thanks to platforms such as Substack and beehiiv that make it easy to deploy them. While this has been a boon for many creators, this has lead to oversaturation.
## newsletters have oversaturated the market

When there’s lots of content and little focus, it’s all just noise. People are interested in a myriad of content to consume, but they’re also looking for better ways to manage their consumption.

## end of the open inbox

One solution that is being rolled out is the use of AI to manage what gets prioritized in someone’s inbox. 

Here’s what that means:
- Email open rates will drop as people consume summaries instead of full emails.
- Ad clicks will collapse as fewer people see newsletter ads.
- The entire value of an “owned audience” declines if AI decides what gets surfaced.

There’s more doom and gloom here, with the general gist that anyone not pivoting or those who are coast on the current order of things will find their newsletters obsolete when these new systems take over.

## the best response to a curated inbox

**Create Content That Can’t Be Summarized**

- The best newsletters make readers stop scrolling.
- If your content can be boiled down to one bullet point, AI will do it for you.
- Build habit-driven content that people want to open, not just skim. See:

**2. Own the Relationship Beyond An Email Address**

- Email alone is not ownership. If AI controls inboxes, your list means nothing.
- Build SMS lists, community spaces, and direct relationships where you control distribution.

**3. Don’t Be a Commodity**

- Most e-commerce brands failed because they sold generic products.
- Most newsletters will fail for the same reason. If you aren’t differentiated, you will be replaced.
- Have an individual at the forefront. People are unique and are memorable, most brands aren’t. Lean into creators and talented individuals to be the face of your content. 

The goal is not just to “own” an audience. The goal is to be so essential that AI can’t filter you out.
