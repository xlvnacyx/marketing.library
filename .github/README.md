Interested in using or contributing to the library?

1. Make sure to have the necessary plugins installed in your vault:

    - [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) 
    - [Custom File Explorer sorting](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort) 
    - [Folder Notes](https://github.com/LostPaul/obsidian-folder-notes) 
    - [Iconize](https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-iconize) 
    - [PDF++](https://github.com/RyotaUshio/obsidian-pdf-plus) 

2. Fork this repository.

3. You can then add this library to your Obsidian vault in one of three ways:

    1. **git submodules**, preferred  
        Navigate to your vault folder and run:
        ```
        git submodule add git@github.com:xlvnacyx/marketing.library Marketing\ Library
        ```

        *Note: This uses git submodules to import a project into an existing 
        git directory and manage it separately. This method assumes you are 
        using git to manage and backup your vault.*

        Use git commands within the library's directory as normal.

    2. **git clone**  
        navigate to your vault folder and run:
        ```
        git clone git@github.com:xlvnacyx/marketing.library Marketing\ Library
        ```

        *Note: This method assumes you are **not** using git to manage your 
        Obsidian vault and will be working from this directory as its own git 
        entity.*

    3. **Download** the `.zip` and unpack it in your vault. This method assumes no 
    desire to contribute back to this library, but rather to make use of 
    its existing content in your own vault and add to your personal instance 
    of it.
