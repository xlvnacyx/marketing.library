## 1 recency bias

> [!quote]
> When a reader has just signed up for your newsletter, they are excited and interested. This is the best time to take action!

# what is the objective of welcome emails?

Take advantage of the recency bias. This may result in
- Turning curious readers into loyal evangelists 
- Making more sales 
- Generating immediate and future revenue 
- Getting more shares and referrals 
- Acquiring valuable insight into your market 
- Gaining more traffic and visibility on social media 

## 2 grab them in the first line

> [!quote]
> even with the advantage of the recency bias, it’s critical to show your readers as soon as possible that your newsletter is different, important, and (hopefully) fun.

## 3 the quirk factor

> [!quote]
> Share a bit of personal quirkiness in your welcome emails. You don’t have to be intrinsically weird (although it might help!). Simply doing something that might seem out of place in a newsletter will help you stand out.

# what should a welcome email include?

## 4 use your welcome email to create more connections

People like what’s familiar, and showing up in the inbox weekly will make someone more familiar. The Welcome Email provides additional opportunities to bump familiarity: include invitations to connect elsewhere, i.e social media.

> To harness the power of commitment and consistency, add a Call To Action (CTA) in your welcome emails. If you don’t have something it makes sense to sell right away, you can still switch on the commitment and consistency juice with a sideways [CTA.](https://blog.beehiiv.com/p/email-cta-examples) 

> A sideways CTA may seem trivial, or even nonsensical. But you’re making it feel normal and appropriate for the reader to do the things that you ask them to do.

## 6 induct readers into your crew

> [!quote]
> Help your readers feel that they are now members of a club.

Here are a few ways to create this sense of belonging: 

- Share your personal philosophy (which is likely to resonate with most readers who were interested enough to subscribe to your newsletter) 
- Lightly ridicule the “Muggles” who are not part of your circle 
- Create an identifying label, such as “cat dads,” that relates to the subject of your newsletter 
- Use the words “we” and “us” in ways that imply the reader is now part of your inner circle 
- Explicitly tell your reader that by subscribing, they have joined an exclusive club

## 7 use better words to set expectations

> [!quote]
> Be creative in the way you set expectations. Have a little fun with it

## 8 reward your subscribers
