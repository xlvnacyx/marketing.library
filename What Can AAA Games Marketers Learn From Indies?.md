The big takeaway from this article, which is based on Derek Lieu’s “How to Hook the Audience and How Quickly to Do it,” are the “three principles I think big budget game devs could learn from indies like Derek Lieu” which I think can be applied to just about any marketing endeavor:

# hook them as quickly as possible
Establish the genre and get to the hook ASAP. Don’t bury the lede, lead with it.

# don’t be embarrassed of your niche
Lieu compares trailers that rely heavily on cinematic footage to “dangling keys in front of a baby.” You’re trying to distract players with shiny footage—a pointless exercise, because they’re not going to pre-order without knowing what your game really is or what makes it special. Even if your game’s genre doesn’t have mass appeal, Lieu says, “you can’t be embarrassed of it.”

# it *has* to be special
One of the biggest mistakes game trailers often make is that they fail to establish what the game really is before trying to sell you on details like the world, the story, and vibe.

The flavor of what? _Oh, ice cream._ _We have 2% milk instead of 1%._ _It's organic…_ I’m not going to leave my house for that.
