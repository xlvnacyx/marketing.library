This is the biggest takeaway from the article: whatever you’re building, create the systems and structure to run with momentum you create.

# 3 secrets to making $10k/month

1. Stakes
2. Building in public
3. Being an expert

# revenue in one month is different than revenue _per_ month

This is where the above quote is recorded. Thomas Yeum was trying different things but there was no system to maintain the momentum he created. After all,

> It’s not monthly recurring revenue unless it recurs.

> Publicly announcing this type of thing is great for motivation. I recommend it for anyone who wants to push themselves and go 100% in one direction.

This section includes two different pieces: the first, summarized in the above quote dealing with motivation, and the second with iterating over and recalibrating published content.

## recipe for an engaging video series

- **Create a short-form video case study** about a specific creator or brand’s social media strategy.
- **Include a CTA to comment a specific word** on the video in order to receive a full-length case study about that subject.
- **Create an automation to DM people** who comment that specific word a link to a piece of gated content; if they sign up, they’ll receive the case study.
