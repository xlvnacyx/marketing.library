# 1 newsletter length is going in the direction of Reels/Tiktoks

Shorter = better

# 2 riches are in niches

The odds are in favor of newsletters creating room for themselves by niching down.

# 3 don’t break news, help readers analyze breaking news

The new vehicle for value is giving readers your perspective on the “so what” - how does this news apply to them, their industry, and their interests?

# 4 pre-newsletter CTAs → post-newsletter CTAs

Social media posts published the day before your newsletter will drive significantly more sign-ups than asking people to sign up the day after.

# 5 stop writing selfish ads/landing pages

Write in terms of outcomes, not features. What will a reader expect to get out of this? Large newsletters write about themselves in terms of features (5-minute stock summaries, career tips, etc.) and not outcomes (make $XYZ per year swing trading, raise your salary, etc.). Change this, and it will reflect in your CPL.

# 6 people follow people not businesses

Adding your face can build loyalty and give you the option to launch products down the road.

# 7 monetize your sign-up flow

If you’re not monetizing your post-sign-up pages with affiliate offers or a low-ticket ($5-20) product, you’re leaving money on the table.

# 8 sponsorship-monetized newsletters are hard

This is an example of a “race to the bottom” condition where cost-per-click is concerned. Diversify.

# 9 are Sparkloop subscribers good or bad?

Not sure what this is, what it appears everyone has an opinion and no one agrees. So …

# 10 this is just the beginning for newsletter industry growth

Given that this article was originally published a year ago, we’re already seeing trends countering this point. While “newsletters are here to stay,” this isn’t to suggest the growth potential is unlimited for everyone. Ultimately, as in [[#8 sponsorship-monetized newsletters are hard|8 above]], the key is to diversify.

See [[Perpetual - The Major Shift of Media]] and [[Ponzi Platform]] for more details.

# conclusion

They aren’t get-rich-quick schemes (like many new operators thought before they started trying to sell sponsorships to closed doors). But there will be many, many more cashflowing businesses and acquisitions that will stand on the shoulders of Beehiiv building the ‘Shopify of newsletters’.
